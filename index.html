    My research interests are in K-12 computer science education and field experiences in engineering education research. I direct the CSC summer high school internship program (<a href="https://go.ncsu.edu/srca-ret-2021" title="NC State Research Experience (RET) for Application Form 2021">go.ncsu.edu/cs-intern-info</a>), the Socially Relevant Computing and Analytics Research Experience for Teachers (<a href="https://go.ncsu.edu/srca-ret-2021" title="NC State Research Experience (RET) for Application Form 2021">go.ncsu.edu/srca-ret-2021</a>), and Research Experience for Undergraduates (<a href="http://go.ncsu.edu/srca-reu" title="SRCA-REU">go.ncsu.edu/srca-reu</a>) programs. I also help lead the field experiences in engineering education study abroad experience to Rwanda infusing computing and hands-on STEM activities to primary and secondary schools.
    
    I am currently an Assistant Professor and formerly a Research Scientist in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University. I am a two time graduate of the department, and I am the second Latina to recieve their Ph.D. here. I recieved numerous awards for my work in local and international computing education and outreach. I am a member of the Global Ingagement Institute at NC State. I teach undergraduate research methods as well as graduate level engineering education courses, and I am the faculty advisor for the student chapter of Students & Technology in Academia, Research, and Service (<a href="http://stars.ncsu.edu/">STARS</a>), of which I have been a student member since 2009. As a graduate student, I was a recipient of both the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship as well as the Microsoft Research Graduate Womens Scholarship.
