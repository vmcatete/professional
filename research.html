    At a high level, my research interests lay in broadening participation in computing to K-12 audiences including students, teachers, and other community stakeholders. Recently I've been working with the <a href="http://go.ncsu.edu/g2l">Game2Learn Lab</a> to develop computing-infused science modules for middle school classrooms. My research in this area explores curriculum for instructor influence, student ownership, collaboration, and creativity, scaffolding designs, and extension activities for advanced learners. My additional research has been in training novice computing teachers in assessment techniques for open-ended student projects as well as assessing curricula for teacher accessibility and equity for student users.

			Support for the project has been provided by the National Science Foundation through grant DRL  <a href="https://nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2148680&amp;HistoricalAwards=false" title="NSF Award Search: Award # 2148680 - Engaging Rural Students in Artificial Intelligence to Develop Pathways for Innovative Computing Careers">2148680</a>, <em>Engaging Rural Students in Artificial Intelligence to Develop Pathways for Innovative Computing Careers</em>.</p><p>
			Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on the design of computing systems that solve problems involving human-like capabilities including reasoning, learning, and natural language. Engaging middle-grade students, especially those from underserved populations, in artificial intelligence through the creation of lifelike AI for digital games offers a promising approach to encouraging students to pursue innovative computing careers. The AI Play project will engage students in a broad range of computing activities centered on creating AI for games. The project will see the development of a learning environment and curriculum that introduces artificial intelligence into middle school emphasizing connections to the CSTA K-12 Computer Science Standards. The AI Play project will host a series of five-day camps for underserved populations where students will engage in hands-on learning activities under the guidance of teachers and undergraduate computer scientists, who will serve as mentors and role models as the students engage in artificial intelligence, while designing and developing AI for games. The final year of the project will see an evaluation of the AI Play program and its impact on students' learning and interest in artificial intelligence.

			Support for the project has been provided by the <a href="https://cic.northeastern.edu/" title="Center for Inclusive Computing">Center for Inclusive Computing at Northeastern University</a> under grant <em>Computer Science Pathways: A Diagnostic Grant to Support Retention and Persistence. </em></p><p>
			The NC State Computer Science Department had doubled undergraduate enrollments and the percentage of women in our program between 2010 and 2020. With this growth, we are challenged with understanding persistence and retention of our students, particularly women. The goal of the diagnostic grant program is to collect and analyze demographic data to better understand where our students are coming from, and if they leave the program, where do they go. The results of the data analysis will provide insights into how we can better support our students to increase persistence, retention, and success..

			The Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP) is a group-based, dual-mentored research structure designed to provide a supportive and inclusive research experience using equity-based practices to grow the confidence and foundational skills of early-career students, particularly African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans and women. For this NSF subaward from UC San Diego, we plan to add ERSP to our course catalog and start implementing it in Fall 2021. As part of their full-year apprenticeship, teams of students will learn about graduate school, be matched to research mentors, observe the mentor's lab, participate in the ERSP course, and propose an independent research project.

		The <a href="http://starscomputingcorps.org/" title="STARS Computing Corps - Diversity, Equity, &amp; Inclusion In Computing">STARS Computing Corps</a> is a national alliance with a mission to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in computing within institutions of higher education and consists of several initiatives. In particular, STARS aims to increase computing persistence and promote career advancement for undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty, with a focus on addressing systemic and social barriers faced by those from underrepresented groups in computing. The STARS Aligned research project seeks to investigate the impact of participation in STARS activities through analysis of alumni interviews, multi-year surveys, and other sources of data. The STARS Ignite program helps faculty prepare to support diverse cohorts of students to attend diversity-oriented conferences, providing scholarships and activities that build community, sense of belonging, and ignite efforts for diversity, equity, and inclusion within their own computing departments. Through workshops, webinars, and online resources, Ignite helps cohorts to follow up on what they've learned at the conference and through the Ignite program to design and implement projects that address their own local context and needs and to take action to broaden participation of underrepresented groups in computing in their home computing department.

Starting in 2016, our research team has provided repeated and varied PD around Snap coding and CT. This relationship has developed into a Research Practice Partnership where teacher leaders from the school and other administrators work together to lead CT integration. We are also trying to replicate our model for integrating CT at new schools in the Charlotte Mecklenburg school district together encompassing the largest two school districts in NC.
